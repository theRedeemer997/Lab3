# üê∂üê± Cats vs Dogs Classification with VGG16 and CNN

This project implements a binary image classification pipeline to distinguish between cats and dogs using:
- ‚úÖ A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- ‚úÖ A Fine-tuned VGG16 model (pretrained on ImageNet)

The notebook includes:
- Data loading from 5000 image subset
- Data augmentation and preprocessing
- CNN model training and evaluation
- VGG16 base model training and fine-tuning
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualization of precision-recall curves
- Misclassification sample inspection

This subset should include **2500 images of cats** and **2500 images of dogs**, evenly distributed.

## üí° Observations
- VGG16 fine-tuning outperforms basic CNN
- Model performance is visualized via training/validation graphs
- Overfitting monitored using validation loss
- Sample misclassifications help understand weaknesses

## Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model File
The CNN model is poushed to the repository without using Git-lfs. 

- For the vgg16 model use
```bash
git lfs pull
```
